# Clean macOS Install

* Back up necessary folders (for me, Projects, optionally Downloads)

* Restart > hold command + r, at Apple logo, or even before

* May need to select account you know password for, then

* Disk Utility > select drive listed under internal > Erase
Name: HDD (or whatever you want)
Format: I use APFS (encrypted) 🤷‍♂️

* Apple logo > Quit disk utility (or command + q)

* Reintall macOS
* Install on newly formatted HDD

Tap, tap, tap, ta-da!
